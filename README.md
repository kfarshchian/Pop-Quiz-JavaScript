# JavaScript Pop Quiz


## Description
This program is a small JavaScript quiz that contains 10 questions about JavaScript. Once you start the quiz you have 15 seconds per question for a total of 150 seconds. If you answer a question wrong 10 seconds is deducted from the total seconds. Once completed your score is saved and you can add your initials and add them to the high score board and keep playing to get the best time. I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make this application. I also used JSON to store the data.
